<h1>Kubernetes Workflow</h1>

<!-- Introduction -->
<p>Kubernetes, also known as K8s or kube, is an open-source platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It's considered the standard for deploying and operating containerized applications, making it simpler to build and run complex applications.</p>

<h2>Kubernetes Architecture</h2>

<!-- Subheading -->
<h3>Cluster Overview</h3>
<p>A Kubernetes cluster is a set of machines, called nodes, that are used to run containerized applications. There are two core pieces in a Kubernetes cluster:</p>

<!-- Unordered List -->
<ul>
    <li><strong>Control Plane:</strong> Manages the state of the cluster. In production environments, the control plane typically runs on multiple nodes across several data center zones. It includes components like the API server, etcd, scheduler, and controller manager.</li>
    <li><strong>Worker Nodes:</strong> These nodes run the containerized application workloads. The applications run in Pods, which are managed by core components like kubelet, container runtime, and kube-proxy.</li>
</ul>

<!-- Subheading -->
<h3>Control Plane Components</h3>
<p>The control plane consists of several core components:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>API Server:</strong> The primary interface between the control plane and the rest of the cluster.</li>
    <li><strong>Scheduler:</strong> Responsible for scheduling Pods onto the worker nodes in the cluster.</li>
    <li><strong>Controller Manager:</strong> Runs controllers that manage the state of the cluster.</li>
</ul>

<!-- Subheading -->
<h3>Worker Node Components</h3>
<p>Worker nodes have several core components that enable them to run containerized applications:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Kubelet:</strong> A daemon that runs on each worker node, communicating with the control plane to manage Pods.</li>
    <li><strong>Container Runtime:</strong> Runs containers on the worker nodes, managing container images, starting and stopping containers, and allocating resources.</li>
    <li><strong>Kube-Proxy:</strong> A network proxy that routes traffic to the correct Pods and provides load balancing.</li>
</ul>

<!-- Subheading -->
<h3>Pods</h3>
<p>Pods are the smallest deployable units in Kubernetes. A Pod hosts one or more containers, providing shared storage and networking for those containers. Pods are the basic building blocks of Kubernetes applications and are created and managed by the Kubernetes control plane.</p>

<h2>When to Use Kubernetes</h2>

<!-- Paragraph -->
<p>Kubernetes is ideal for organizations needing:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Scalability & High Availability:</strong> It supports self-healing, automatic rollbacks, and horizontal scaling to quickly respond to demand.</li>
    <li><strong>Portability:</strong> Ensures consistent deployment and management across on-premise, public cloud, or hybrid environments.</li>
    <li><strong>Uniform Management:</strong> Provides a standardized method for packaging, deploying, and managing applications.</li>
</ul>

<!-- Subheading -->
<h2>Drawbacks of Kubernetes</h2>

<!-- Paragraph -->
<ul>
    <li><strong>Complexity:</strong> Challenging to set up and operate, requiring significant expertise and resources.</li>
    <li><strong>High Upfront Cost:</strong> Expensive to implement and maintain, especially for smaller organizations.</li>
    <li><strong>Resource-Intensive:</strong> Requires substantial resources, making it potentially excessive for smaller setups.</li>
</ul>

<!-- Subheading -->
<h2>Managed Kubernetes Services</h2>
<p>For those seeking to offload the complexity of managing Kubernetes, managed services provided by cloud providers are an excellent option. Some popular services include:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Amazon EKS</strong> (Elastic Kubernetes Service)</li>
    <li><strong>GKE</strong> (Google Kubernetes Engine)</li>
    <li><strong>AKS</strong> (Azure Kubernetes Service)</li>
</ul>
<p>These services handle tasks like setting up and configuring the control plane, scaling the cluster, and providing ongoing maintenance and support, making Kubernetes accessible for mid-size organizations. For small organizations, the principle of YAGNI (You Ainâ€™t Gonna Need It) may apply, recommending against over-engineering with Kubernetes.</p>

<h2>Kubernetes Workflow Overview</h2>

<!-- Ordered List -->
<ol>
    <li>
        <h3>Plan & Design</h3>
        <p>Define the application architecture and requirements. Decide on cluster size, resource limits, and scaling policies.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Containerize Application</h3>
        <p>Create Docker images for each application component and push them to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, Google Container Registry).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Write Kubernetes Manifests</h3>
        <p>Create YAML files for Pods, Deployments, Services, and ConfigMaps. Define desired states like replicas, environment variables, and service types.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Set Up Kubernetes Cluster</h3>
        <p>Provision a Kubernetes cluster on your chosen infrastructure (on-premise, cloud, or hybrid). Install necessary tools like kubectl and Helm for cluster management.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Deploy Application</h3>
        <p>Apply Kubernetes manifests using <code>kubectl apply -f &lt;manifest&gt;.yaml</code>. Verify that Pods, Services, and other resources are running as expected.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Monitor & Scale</h3>
        <p>Use Kubernetes' built-in tools (e.g., kubectl, Prometheus) to monitor application performance and scale horizontally or vertically as needed.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Manage & Update</h3>
        <p>Roll out updates to the application using Kubernetes Deployments for smooth transitions, and utilize automatic rollbacks in case of failures.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Maintain & Optimize</h3>
        <p>Regularly update Kubernetes and its components. Optimize resource usage by fine-tuning requests and limits, and scaling policies.</p>
    </li>
</ol>

<p>This workflow provides a structured approach to deploying, managing, and scaling containerized applications using Kubernetes, making the platform accessible even to those who are new to container orchestration.</p>
